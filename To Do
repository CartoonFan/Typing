***BIG CHANGES***

 - Use trigraphs; try to make a layout with two rolls on one hand plus one key on the other. Do something like Carpalx.
 - Add shift, space, enter, backspace, tab. On Kinesis, add thumb pads and leftmost column.
 - Add shifted keys.

***SMALL CHANGES***

 - Change char and digraph files to include every character and digraph, and then filter out the useless ones at runtime.
 - Moving further along one hand costs more. For example, moving from a pinky to an index finger costs more than moving from a middle finger to an index finger.
 - Every movement from one finger to another has its own specific price.
 

***BUGS***

 - After the algrithm runs for a while, either a character is duplicated or a character that's not supposed to be on the keyboard somehow creeps in.


***MISCELLANEOUS***

 - Convert layouts in all_layouts.txt to Kinesis form.

***SHIFTED KEYS***

 - Add shifted keys to the character and digraph lists.
 - Take shifted keys into account in the fitness function.
 - Change shuffleLayout(), mutate(), and smartMutate() to allow punctuation to move from shifted to unshifted and vice versa.
