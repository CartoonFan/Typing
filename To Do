***BIG CHANGES***

 * Use trigraphs; try to make a layout with two rolls on one hand plus one key on the other. Do something like Carpalx.
 * Add shift, space, enter, backspace, tab. On Kinesis, add thumb pads and leftmost column.
 * Add shifted keys.

***SMALL CHANGES***

 - Moving further along one hand costs more. For example, moving from a pinky to an index finger costs more than moving from a middle finger to an index finger.
 - Every movement from one finger to another has its own specific price.
 

***BUGS***

 * After the algrithm runs for a while, either a character is duplicated or a character that's not supposed to be on the keyboard somehow creeps in.


***MISCELLANEOUS***

 - Convert layouts in all_layouts.txt to Kinesis form.
