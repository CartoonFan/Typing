***BETTER LAYOUTS***

 - Use trigraphs; try to make a layout with two rolls on one hand plus one key on the other. Do something like Carpalx.
 - Moving further along one hand costs more. For example, moving from a pinky to an index finger costs more than moving from a middle finger to an index finger.
 - Every movement from one finger to another has its own specific price.


***MISCELLANEOUS***

 - Convert layouts in all_layouts.txt to Kinesis form.
